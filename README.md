# react-vite

Welcome to the **React with Vite Project**! This repository is dedicated to testing React and Vite for the first time. The goal is to explore the capabilities of Vite as a build tool and development server for a React application. The exercises and examples in this repository are part of the Full Stack Open course. This will be my frontend for my phonebook project.
